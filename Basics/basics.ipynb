    "The first two sections of the E3.series python libraries version are equal to the version of E3.series version they are meant to be used with.\n",
    "Which means, it is best to use a library version 26.21.XX with a E3.series version 26.21. It is possible to a library version that does not match your E3.series version. If the version of the library is higher than the version of your E3.series version the library may contain functions your E3.series does not support. In this case you will get an exception whn using such a function. This can be avoided by checking the minimum version required by the function, which is given at the bottom of tooltip of each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Minimum required version in the tooltip](VersionInTooltip.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the version of your E3.series is higher than the version of your library there might be some functions the library does not support. In this case you cannot use those functions via the library. It is also important to note that, in addition to COM functions, newer versions of the library provide further independent functionality. In addition there might be some bugfixes available only in newer versions.\n",

    "| E3.series version | Python library version |  |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 23.20 | 26.10.0 | The library works for every function supported in E3.series 23.20. It will raise an excption for unsupported functioality. For example dbe.CreateDbeJobObject() |\n",
    "| 26.10 | 26.10.0 | Everything in the library is supported by E3.series 26.10, and all functios in E3.series 26.10 are supported by the library. But e3series.tools.Translation is not contained and there might be unfixed bugs. |\n",
    "| 26.21 | 26.10.0 | All function in the E3.series version are available in the library. There might be functions in the library that are unsupported by your E3.series version. Using them leads to an exception. |\n",
